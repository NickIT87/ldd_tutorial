(gdb) print a
$2 = {1, 2, 3}

(gdb) ptype a
type = int [3]

use x to see what a looks like under the hood

(gdb) x/12xb &a
0x7fffffffded0:	0x01	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x02	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7fffffffded8:	0x03	0x00	0x00	0x00

The first four bytes store a[0], the next four store a[1], and the final four store a[2]. 

Indeed, you can check that sizeof knows that aâ€™s size in memory is twelve bytes:

(gdb) print sizeof(a)
$3 = 12
