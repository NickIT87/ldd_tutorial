sudo command
=============

sudo -- super user do

 If you prefix “sudo” with any command, it will run that command with elevated privileges or in other words allow a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser. 

This is the equivalent of “run as administrator” option in Windows

$dmesg -c

$sudo dmesg -c

$sudo -s
